This package is based on the code from the package [go-mgo/mgo/internal/json](https://github.com/go-mgo/mgo/tree/v2-unstable/internal/json) written by Gustavo Niemeyer (@niemeyer), witch is itself based on an old version of the [json](https://github.com/golang/go/tree/go1.14/src/encoding/json) package of the go standard library.
